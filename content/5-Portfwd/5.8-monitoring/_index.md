### Overview
After completing the deployment and testing of the **AnTiScaQ** system (or finishing the Workshop exercises), the final and extremely important administrative step is **Resource Cleanup**. Accidentally leaving cloud services running in the background when no longer needed will lead to unexpected costs on AWS.

In this section, we will perform a secure removal and thorough cleanup of the entire AWS infrastructure ecosystem allocated to the project, including:

* **Computing & Applications (Elastic Beanstalk, ECR):** Completely terminate the backend environment and delete the application's Docker image repositories.
* **Storage & Data (RDS, S3):** Permanently delete the MySQL relational database (without creating a final backup) and clean up the frontend/static resource storage buckets.
* **Network & Distribution (VPC, CloudFront):** Disable the global content delivery network and remove the application's internal virtual network infrastructure.
* **Monitoring (CloudWatch):** Clean up and remove established automatic alarm streams.

### Actions Taken
* [Resource Cleanup](5.8.1-cloudwatch//)
